### An Accurate Translation

It is very important to make sure that the new translation is accurate. Those who have been chosen to check the translation for accuracy have the responsibility to make sure that it communicates the same meaning as the original writer intended and expected to communicate.  

For instructions on how to do this, go to [Accuracy Check](en/ta/checking/man/accuracy-check), and follow the steps in the section under the heading "All Levels."
