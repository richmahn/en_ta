unfoldingWord® Translation Academy is intended to enable anyone, anywhere to equip themselves so that they will be able to make high-quality translations of biblical content into their own language. unfoldingWord® Translation Academy is designed to be highly flexible. It can be used in a systematic, in-advance approach or it can be used for just-in-time learning (or both, as needed). It is modular in structure.
