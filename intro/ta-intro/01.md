### Welcome to translationAcademy

The "translationAcademy" is intended to enable anyone, anywhere to equip themselves so that they will be able to make high-quality translations of biblical content into their own language. translationAcademy is designed to be highly flexible. It can be used in a systematic, in-advance approach or it can be used for just-in-time learning (or both, as needed). It is modular in structure. 

translationAcademy contains the following sections:

  * [Introduction](../ta-intro/01.md) - introduces the unfoldingWord project
  * [Process Manual](../../process/process-manual/01.md)  - answers the question "what next?"
  * [Translation Manual](../../translate/translate-manual/01.md) - explains the basics of translation theory and practical translation helps
  * [Checking Manual](../../checking/intro-check/01.md) - explains the basics of checking theory and best practices
  * [Audio Manual](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-ta-audio/src/master/content/audio_introduction.md) - How to do high quality audio recordings
  * [Gateway Languages Manual](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-ta-gl/src/master/content/gl_translate.md) - explains issues specific to the Gateway Languages

Several of the manuals are separated into two volumes. Volume 1 of each manual covers the basics of that subject while volume 2 goes more in depth. In general, if a module is needed to translate and publish Open Bible Stories, then it is included in volume 1, if not, then it is included in volume 2.
