## Logical Relationships

The final group of connectors establish logical relationships between the parts of the sentence.

### Goal (or Purpose) Relationship 

#### Definition

A Goal Relationship is a logical relationship in which the second event is the purpose or goal of the first event. In order for something to be a Goal relationship, someone must do the first event with the intention that it will cause the second event.

#### Reason this is a translation issue

In Scripture, the goal or purpose may be stated first or second. In some languages it must always occur in only one of those positions for that logical relationship to be understood. Translators need to understand the relationship between the two parts and communicate those accurately in their language. This may require changing the order of the two events. It may also require specific words to indicate that one is the goal or purpose of the other. Words commonly used to indicate a goal relationship in English are “in order to,” “in order that” or “so that.” It is important that the translator recognize the words that signal a goal relationship and translate that relationship in a natural way.

> But when the vine growers saw the son, they said among themselves, ‘This is the heir. Come, let us kill him <u>and take over his inheritance</u>.’ So they took him, threw him out of the vineyard and killed him. (Matt 21:38-39 ULT)

>>>>>>> Stashed changes

The Purpose of the vine growers killing the heir was so they could take over his inheritance. They state both events to each other as a plan, joining them only with “and.” Then the word “so” marks the reporting of the first event, but the second event (the Goal or Purpose) is not stated.

#### Translation Strategies

If your language uses purpose or goal relationships in the same way as in the text, then use them as they are.

1. If the construction of the goal statement is unclear, change it to one that is more clear.
2. If the order of the statements makes the goal statement unclear or confusing for the reader, then change the order.

#### Examples of Translation Strategies Applied

(1) If the construction of the goal statement is unclear, change it to one that is more clear.
