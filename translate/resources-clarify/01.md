### Description

When the Unlocked Dynamic Bible provides a good alternate translation for the ULB, then usually there is not a Note for the ULB text. However, when the Note gives more than one suggested translation for a word or phrase, the Note may include text from the UDB as one of the suggested translations. In that case the text from the UDB will be followed by "(UDB)."

### Translation Notes Examples

>they <u>implored him</u> to stay with them. (John 4:40 **ULB**)

>they <u>urged him</u> to stay a longer time with them. (John 4:40 **UDB**)

The Note for this verse says:

  * **implored him**  - "begged him" or "urged him" (UDB)

Here the suggested translation for the words 'implored him' is 'begged him.' The words, 'urged him' from the UDB have a similar meaning and are included as another suggestion.

>When he saw Jesus, <u>he fell on his face</u>. (Luke 5:12 **ULB**)

>When he saw Jesus, <u>he bowed down to the ground</u>. (Luke 5:12 **UDB**)

The Note for this verse says:

  * **he fell on his face** - "he knelt and touched the ground with his face" or "he bowed down to the ground" (UDB)

Here the words from the UDB are provided as another translation suggestion.
