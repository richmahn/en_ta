### How do I start?

Follow these steps in order to get started:

1. **Organize.** Talk with the pastors and other believers from your language group and form a committee of people who can work together as a translation team. 
1. **Contact.**  Make contact with at least one element of the unfoldingWord network, notifying unfoldingWord that you intend to begin translation. To get information about how to do that, see [Finding Answers](../../intro/finding-answers/01.md)
1. **Review.**  Review the [Translation Guidelines](../../intro/translation-guidelines/01.md).
1. **Agree.**  Agree that the Statement of Faith is an accurate reflection of your own beliefs and that you intend to translate the content in harmony with it and also in accordance with the Translation Guidelines by signing the form. (see http://ufw.io/forms/)
1. **Pray.** Pray that God would help you to understand the passage that you are translating and that he would help you to find the best way to communicate that passage in your language.
1. **Read.** 
  * If you are translating Open Bible Stories, read the entire story before starting to translate it. If you are translating the Bible, read the entire chapter before you start to translate any part of it. This way you will understand how the part you are translating fits into the larger context, and you will translate it better.
  * Read the passage that you plan to translate in as many different translations as you have. If you are using translationStudio, it contains at least two Bible texts, the unfoldingWord Literal Text (ULT) and the unfoldingWord Simplified Text (UST). The ULT will help you to see the form of the original text, and the UST will help you to understand the meaning of the original text. Think about how to communicate the meaning in the form that people would use in your language. 
  * Read any Bible helps or commentaries that you have that talk about that passage.
  * Read the translationNotes for the passage that you plan to translate.
  * Read the definitions of important terms in the list called “translationWords” for each highlighted word in the passage that you plan to translate.
1. **Talk.** Discuss the passage, the translationNotes, and the translationWords with others in the translation team. Help each other to understand what they mean. If there are parts that you still do not understand, ask pastors or other church leaders for help.
2. **Translate.** When you understand well what the passage is saying, say the first chunk (1-3 verses) out loud in your language in the way that someone from your language community would say it. If possible, say it to another member of the translation team. Let the translation team member correct it until it sounds good in your language. Do not follow the order of words from the source text if it is more natural for your language to use a different order. To help with this, say the whole chunk of text without looking at the source text. This will help you to say these things in a way that is natural for your language, rather than in a way that was natural for the source language but that is not the best way to say it in your language. Still without looking at the source text, type your translation of the chunk into translationStudio (or record it). When you type (or write) from your memory without looking at the source text, your translation will be more natural. 
1. **Check**. Since you typed or recorded your translation of a chunk without looking at the source text, you might have left out a few things. Now is the time to add those things to your translation.  
  * Look again at the source text and carefully compare it to your translation. Make sure that it says all of the parts of the message of the source text and does not leave out anything. If some part of the message was missing, put it in your translation at the point where it fits best in your language. It does not need to be in the same order as the source as long as it sounds natural and gives the same meaning. 
  * If you are translating the Bible, compare your translation with other translations of the same Bible passage. If one of those makes you think of a better way to say something, then revise your translation in that way. If one of those helps you to understand something better than you did before, then change your translation so that it communicates the meaning better.
  * After these steps, read your translation out loud to yourself. Fix anything that does not sound like it is the way that someone from your community would say it. Sometimes parts of sentences need to be put in a different order.  

Now translate the next chunk of the passage in the same way (step 8) and check it in the same way (step 9). When you finish the passage or chapter, it is ready for the [Oral Partner Check](../../checking/peer-check/01.md). To translate the next passage or chapter, start again at step 5.
