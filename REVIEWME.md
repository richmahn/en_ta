These items need review
--
After converting tA into a [Resource Container](http://resource-container.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) 
there were a few items that need to be manually reviewed for correctness.

## intro
`/open-license` has links to legacy tA modules.
Should we remove these links entirely since they are deprecated?

```
unknown tA module 'audio' in link: https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-ta-audio/src/master/content/audio_introduction.md
unknown tA module 'gl' in link: https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-ta-gl/src/master/content/gl_translate.md
unknown tA module 'gl' in link: https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-ta-gl/src/master/content/gl_translate.md
unknown tA module 'audio' in link: https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-ta-audio/src/master/content/audio_introduction.md
unknown tA module 'gl' in link: https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-ta-gl/src/master/content/gl_translate.md
```
