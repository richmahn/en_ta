### What to Know Before Translation

It is recommended that you consult the [Translation Manual](en/ta/translate/man/translate-manual) frequently as you translate this content. Before you start translating, we recommend that you start working your way through the Translation Manual at least until you know the difference between a literal translation and a meaning-based translation. Much of the rest of the Translation Manual can be used as a "just-in-time" learning resource.

Some important subjects that must be learned before starting a translation project:

  * [The Qualities of a Good Translation](en/ta/translate/man/guidelines-intro) - The definition of a good translation
  * [The Translation Process](en/ta/translate/man/translate-process) - How a good translation is made
    * [Form and Meaning](en/ta/translate/man/translate-fandm) - The difference between form and meaning
    * [Meaning-Based Translations](en/ta/translate/man/translate-dynamic) - How to make a meaning-based translation

Some other important topics as you get started include:

  * [Choosing What to Translate](en/ta/translate/man/translation-difficulty) - Suggestions for where to start translating
  * [First Draft](en/ta/translate/man/first-draft) - How to make a first draft
