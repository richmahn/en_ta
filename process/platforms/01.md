### Recommended Platform

The recommended platform for drafting Bible translations in the Door43 ecosystem is translationStudio (http://ufw.io/ts/) and the recommended platform for checking Bible translations is translationCore (http://ufw.io/tc/). You may set up translationStudio on Android, Windows, Mac, or Linux devices (see [Setting up translationStudio](../setup-ts/01.md) for more information). You may set up translationCore on Windows, Mac, or Linux devices. These platforms are free to download and use. They import and export Bible books in USFM format.

### Other Options

If using translationStudio is not an option for your team, then you may consider using other online or offline tools. Note that it will be your responsibility to get the content into USFM format if you do not use translationStudio but do want to use other Bible translation software (see [File Formats](../../translate/file-formats/01.md) for more information).
