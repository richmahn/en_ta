### Purpose of Checking Levels

The purpose of the Checking Levels (see [Checking Manual](en/ta/checking/man/intro-check)) is primarily to help ensure that the translation has been made in accordance with the [Statement of Faith](en/ta/intro/man/statement-of-faith) and the [Translation Guidelines](en/ta/intro/man/translation-guidelines). Another reason is to increase the input and ownership of the community that will be using it.

#### Checking Level 1

Checking Level 1 is done primarily by the translation team, with some input from the language community. See [Checking Level One - Affirmation by Translation Team](en/ta/checking/man/level1). After completing the Level 1 Check, you are encouraged to upload to Door43 (see [Introduction to Publishing](en/ta/process/man/intro-publishing)) and continue on to Checking Level 2 (see below). 

#### Checking Level 2

Checking Level 2 is done to verify that representative groups from the local language community agree that the translation is a good one (see [Checking Level Two - Affirmation by Community](en/ta/checking/man/level2)). It is done with a language community check (see [Language Community Check](en/ta/checking/man/language-community-check)) and a church leader check (see [Church Leader Check](en/ta/checking/man/church-leader-check)). After completing the Level 2 Check, you are encouraged to upload to Door43 (see [Introduction to Publishing](en/ta/process/man/intro-publishing)) and continue on to Checking Level 3 (see below), if you so desire. 

#### Checking Level 3

Checking Level 3 is done when leaders of at least two church networks agree that the translation is a good one (see [Checking Level Three - Affirmation by Church Leadership](en/ta/checking/man/level3)). Be sure you work through the Level 3 Checking Questions (see [Questions for Checking on Level Three](en/ta/checking/man/level3-questions)) while you complete this checking level. After completing the Level 3 Check, you are encouraged to upload to Door43 (see [Introduction to Publishing](en/ta/process/man/intro-publishing)). This is the highest checking level. Gateway Languages should also complete the [Source Text Process](en/ta/process/man/source-text-process)
