# English translationAcademy

## Overview

translationAcademy is intended to enable anyone, anywhere to equip themselves so that they will be able to make high-quality translations of biblical content into their own language. translationAcademy is designed to be highly flexible. It can be used in a systematic, in-advance approach or it can be used for just-in-time learning (or both, as needed). It is modular in structure.

translationAcademy was developed by the [Door43 World Missions Community](https://door43.org) in conjunction with [Wycliffe Associates](http://www.wycliffeassociates.org/).  The entire project is made
